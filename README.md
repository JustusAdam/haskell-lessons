# A repository with learning material for the Haskell course

`script` contains the manuscript for the lessons, which should also serve as a reference for the students.
The script is written in reStructured text which makes it easy to generate beautiful html pages as well as pdfs.

`slides` contains a shortened version of the script, pressed into slides. This uses markdown generated from the reST script sources and then edited, and is compiled into reveal.js slides.

`Shakefile.hs` serves as a makefile for automating the build process.

You may use the issue section to leave feedback on the course itself.

See my ideas for future lessons in [this file](IDEAS.md). 
Anyone can submit new ides in issue #2.
