`script` contains the manuscript for the lessons, which should also serve as a reference for the students.
The script is written in reStructured text which makes it easy to generate beautiful html pages as well as pdfs.

`slides` contains a shortened version of the script, pressed into slides. This also uses reStructured text, and is compiled into reveal.js slides.
